# Hi, I'm Dave 👋

<strong>I am a Senior Front-end Engineer and Designer.</strong>

I strive while utilising both the logical and creative part of the brain. I feel most in my place while continuously operating in these roles as a front-end developer within a team. I stand for quality, innovation and building useful products with a focus on the human using the product. I am a proactive, confident and communicatively strong person always looking ahead in the future.

## Writing 📝
I write a lot on a wide range of topics regarding front-end development and everything linked to that. You can have a look at [davebitter.com](https://www.davebitter.com)!
